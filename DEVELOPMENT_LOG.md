... (previous sessions) ...

## Session 12: Backend - Real-time Log Streaming
- **Date**: 2025-08-29 00:42:27 UTC
- **Architect**: Forge
- **Changes**:
    - `UPDATE`: `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Refactored `run_workflow` to be event-driven.
    - `UPDATE`: `src/pages/PlaygroundPage.tsx` - Re-architected to handle real-time events.
    - `UPDATE`: `TESTING_PLAN.md` - Updated test to verify streaming.

## Session 13: Finalization and Polish
- **Date**: 2025-08-29 00:46:20 UTC
- **Architect**: mateimarcu
- **Changes**:
    - `UPDATE`: `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Removed the development-only `sleep` from the traversal loop. Added a new `execution-finished` event that is emitted upon successful completion of a workflow run.
    - `UPDATE`: `src/pages/PlaygroundPage.tsx` - Removed the `setTimeout`-based workaround. The component now listens for the `execution-finished` event to reliably re-enable the "Run Workflow" button, creating a robust, event-driven UI state.
    - `UPDATE`: `README.md` - Updated the main project README with final feature descriptions and setup instructions.
    - `UPDATE`: `TESTING_PLAN.md` - Consolidated all previous tests into a final, comprehensive regression test plan suitable for long-term maintenance.
    - **Conclusion**: The project is now feature-complete, polished, and fully documented.
